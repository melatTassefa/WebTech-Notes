# Data Types in Java Script

There are two kinds of data types in java script:

1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non-primitive Data Types

## 1. Primitive Data Types

In primitive data types, the value and the identity are stored in the same memory space. Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types, and they can be compared by their values.

1. Numbers - include Integers, floats.
- Math Object: provides ways to work with numbers. It includes the following methods: PI, E, round(), floor(), ceil(),min(), max(), random(), random() *11, abs(), sqrt(), pow(), log(), LN(), sin(), cos()
- Generating a random number: Among the methods mentioned above, random() is used to generate a random number between 0 and 0.9999. Meanwhile, random() * 11 is used to generate a random number between 0 and 10.

Let’s see some of these with examples:

```jsx
let x = Math.random();  //Generates a random number between 0 and 0.9999
console.log(x);
let y = Math.random() * 11; //Generates a random number between 0 and 10.9999
let z = Math.floor(y);  // rounds the above number to the integer below it
console.log(z);
```

1. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote.
- String concatenation: Connecting two or more strings together. Done using Addition operator. It’s usually Error prone.
- Long Literal Strings: use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line.
- Escape Sequences in Strings: \n (new line), \t (tab, 8 spaces), \'(Single Quote), \" (double quote).
- Template Literals(Template Strings): are used to inject data as expressions inside a string. Two back-ticks are used to create template literals.

```jsx
//Syntax `String literal text ${expression}`
```

- String Methods: There are a number of String methods including the common ones like string.length(returns number of characters including empty space), [index]( used to access each character in a String), toUpperCase()(changes string into uppercase), toLowerCase()(changes to lowercase), and new ones listed below:
    - substr(): takes two arguments, the starting index and number of characters to slice.
    - substring(): takes two arguments, the starting index and the stopping index but it doesn’t include the character at the stopping index.
    - split(): changes to array, split(' ')-split to array at space, split('')-split each element.
    - trim(): Removes trailing space in the beginning or the end of a string.
    - includes(): It takes a substring argument and it checks if substring argument exists in the string. includes() returns a boolean. If a substring exist in a string, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
    - replace(): takes as a parameter the old substring and a new substring.
    - charAt(): Takes index and it returns the value at that index.
    - charCodeAt(): Takes index and it returns char code (ASCII number) of the value at that index.
    - indexOf(): Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the first position of the substring if does not exist it returns -1.
    - lastIndexOf(): Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the last position of the substring if it does not exist it returns -1.
    - concat(): it takes many substrings and joins them.
    - startsWith: it takes a substring as an argument and it checks if the string starts with that specified substring. It returns a boolean(true or false).
    - endsWith: it takes a substring as an argument and it checks if the string ends with that specified substring. It returns a boolean(true or false).
    - match: it takes a substring or regular expression pattern as an argument and it returns an array if there is match if not it returns null. Let us see how a regular expression pattern looks like. It starts with / sign and ends with / sign.
    - search: it takes a substring as an argument and it returns the index of the first match. The search value can be a string or a regular expression pattern.
    - repeat(): it takes a number as argument and it returns the repeated version of the string.
1. Booleans - true or false value.
2. Null - empty value or no value.
3. Undefined - a declared variable without a value.
4. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor.

## 2. Non-primitive Data Types

In non-primitive data types, identifier holds the address for the memory space containing the value(Non primitive DT). Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable, cannot be compared by value.

Non-primitive data types in JavaScript include:

1. Objects
2. Arrays

## Checking Data Types and Casting

### Checking Data Types

We use the typeof method.

### Changing Data Types(Casting)

We use parseInt(), parseFloat(), Number(), + sign, str().

- String to Int

We use parseInt(), Number(), Plus sign(+).

- String to Float

We use parseFloat(), Number(), Plus sign(+).

- Float to Int

We use parseInt().
